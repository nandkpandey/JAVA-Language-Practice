Shelves: A number of shelves are given. Assign shelf numbers to the shelves as s1, s2, s3 â€¦

Shopkeeper: The shopkeeper is the one who adds an item to the shelf having the lowest number of items.

Customer: The customer is the one who picks an item from the shelf having the highest number of items.

Iterations: Total number of times the Shopkeeper adds an item or the customer picks an item from the shelf.


*If two shelves have an equal number of items, the shopkeeper/customer adds items or picks items from the shelf with the lower shelf number. 
For e.g., if shelf-2 (s2) and shelf-3 (s3) have two items each, then the shopkeeper/customer will choose shelf-2 (s2).


Output: Print number of items in each shelf whenever shopkeeper/customer adds or picks the item from the shelf.
